# Story Of Bitty Of Life.

<p> Bitty of life is my future blog that I have always wanted to build.As a little kid and even today ive always loved writing. 
Whether it was just writing my thoughts on something or creating stories. </p>
<p> Bitty of life was born from that love. this year one of my new year resolutions was overcoming something that gave me anxiety. And the internet was one of those things.
Ive always been afraid of putting myself out there but this year I wanted to change that and I thought. Why not create a blog? </p>
<p> I originally was planning on creating it using wordpress. And honestly one day I might(When I can afford business or premium tier ðŸ˜…) but for now I'm going to be 
  creating it using the skills I have. This is definitely been very tough. But i've learned alot. And I havent been this excited for a project 
  since I created my first app with js.</p>
