# Story Of Bitty Of Life.

<p> Bitty of life is my future blog that I have always wanted to build.As a little kid and even today I have always loved writing. 
Whether it was just writing my thoughts on something or creating stories. Writing was my way of expressing myself as I was not a kid who was very talkative.</p>
<p> Bitty of life was born from that love. This year one of my new year resolutions was overcoming something that gave me anxiety. And the internet was one of those things. 
Ive always been afraid of putting myself out there because the iternet is just so vast but this year I wanted to change that and I thought, why not create a blog? </p>
<p> I originally was planning on creating it using Wordpress. And honestly, one day I might(When I can afford business or premium tier ðŸ˜…) but for now I'm going to be 
  creating it using the skills I have. This has definitely been very tough. But I have learned quite a lot. This project has got me so excited. It feels like one of those things you do for little you. This project has become my baby and I am excited to see it grow.</p>
